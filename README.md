# Technical Challenge for LOGISTICS UK

Normally, I would have used Material components with Emotion, but as requested, I have chosen to use React components.  
For this challenge, I used React with Tailwind CSS. As with all my projects, I also chose to use TypeScript, which is becoming increasingly popular, especially for large projects.  
To save time, I used a React template called `template-vite-react-ts-tailwind` to start my project.  
This template came with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS plugins installed.  

Some updates to the React version had to be made before I started.

Each page and component comes with tests and can be run from npm. For example:
- `npm run build`
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run test`

I've not included a prototype as the task already came with a wireframe outlining how the application should look.

The driver data has been moved to the public folder area, as it is external data and not a core part of the application, unlike the `menu.json` file.

## Usage

The application defaults to the home page. To facilitate the request for a breakdown of the drivers' time, there is a popup that appears when you hover over the driver's total time.

I have included some basic data for the driver and vehicle pages, even though this was not requested, for completeness.
